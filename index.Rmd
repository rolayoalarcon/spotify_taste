# Hi!  

My name is Roberto Olayo :). I am a PhD at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet, at the department of statistics.  
Like anyone else, I really enjoy music. So to have some fun, I compared my musical taste to that of my friends, and any other users I can get my hands on.
  
If you have any suggestions, please let me know!
